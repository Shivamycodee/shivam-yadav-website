# Why Build AlienMeet?

I‚Äôve built multiple apps using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), like [Dverse](https://dverse-git.vercel.app/videocall). Compared to video calls on platforms like WhatsApp or Google Meet, I found WebRTC to be significantly faster. This is because it eliminates the third party through which all data is routed, resulting in improved speed and enhanced privacy.  
That‚Äôs why I built **AlienMeet** ‚Äî a faster, more private way to connect.

# Centralized vs Decentralized Video Calls

# How it works

- When the user provides camera and microphone permissions and clicks on **'Talk to Aliens'**, a WebSocket connection is created to a server. The server assigns a `peerId` to the system and attempts to find an open peer to match the user with. Once a match is found, the server shares their WebSocket connections with each other, and the frontend code handles all the sending and receiving of audio and video streams.

- As you can see, there is no centralization here. The server is only used to connect random peers with each other. This kind of server is called a **Signaling Server**, and it does not store any user data.


# Tech Used

  - The entire project is built using **TypeScript**.
    
-   **Vite.js** is used for frontend development.
    
-   **Node.js** is used for the server application.

# Overview of webRTC 

In simple terms, **WebRTC** enables two systems to connect and exchange media streams (like video and audio) directly without using a third-party server. WebRTC uses JavaScript APIs such as **RTCPeerConnection** and **RTCDataChannel** to connect, listen, and transmit streams. It also employs **ICE Candidates**, **STUN servers**, and **TURN servers** to establish and maintain peer-to-peer connections.
